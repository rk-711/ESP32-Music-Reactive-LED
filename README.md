# ESP32-Music-Reactive-LED
A music-reactive LED project using ESP32, WS2812B LED strip, and MAX9814 microphone module. The LEDs dynamically change colors and patterns based on real-time audio input, creating a visually engaging light show. Built with Arduino IDE and customizable for different effects and patterns.

# üé∂ ESP32 Music Reactive LED Strip Project

This project uses an **ESP32**, a **MAX9814 microphone module**, and a **WS2812B addressable LED strip** to create a **music reactive lighting effect**.  
The LEDs change color and brightness based on the real-time audio signal captured by the microphone.

## üìÑ Code
The Arduino code reads the microphone's analog output and maps the volume to LED brightness and color.  
You can find the code in the repository file: **`Music_Reactive_LED.ino`**

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Install **Arduino IDE** and add **ESP32 board support**.
2. Install **Adafruit NeoPixel** library from Library Manager.
3. Upload the code to your ESP32.
4. Play music near the MAX9814 microphone.
5. Watch your LEDs react in real-time!
