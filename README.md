# ESP32-Music-Reactive-LED
A music-reactive LED project using ESP32, WS2812B LED strip, and MAX9814 microphone module. The LEDs dynamically change colors and patterns based on real-time audio input, creating a visually engaging light show. Built with Arduino IDE and customizable for different effects and patterns.

# üé∂ ESP32 Music Reactive LED Strip Project

This project uses an **ESP32**, a **MAX9814 microphone module**, and a **WS2812B addressable LED strip** to create a **music reactive lighting effect**.  
The LEDs change color and brightness based on the real-time audio signal captured by the microphone.

## Wiring Diagram  

| ESP32 Pin      | MAX9814 Module      | WS2812B LED Strip | VCC / GND       |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 3V3            | VCC (MAX9814)       | VCC (LED Strip)   | +3.3V / +5V      |
| GND            | GND (MAX9814)       | GND (LED Strip)   | GND             |
| GPIO 15        | OUT (MAX9814)       | -                | -               |
| GPIO 5         | -                   | DIN (LED Strip)   | -               |

**Notes:**  
- Use an external 5V supply for long LED strips.  
- Connect grounds (ESP32, power supply, LED strip) together.  
- Add a 330Œ© resistor in series with DIN and a 1000 ¬µF capacitor across VCC‚ÄìGND of the LED strip for safety.

## üìÑ Code
The Arduino code reads the microphone's analog output and maps the volume to LED brightness and color.  
You can find the code in the repository file: **`Music_Reactive_LED.ino`**

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Install **Arduino IDE** and add **ESP32 board support**.
2. Install **Adafruit NeoPixel** library from Library Manager.
3. Upload the code to your ESP32.
4. Play music near the MAX9814 microphone.
5. Watch your LEDs react in real-time!
